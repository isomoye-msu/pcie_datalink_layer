# (Open-Source) PCIe Endpoint Controller (WORK IN PROGESS)

This repository provides an open-source PCIe 1.0 Endpoint Controller implemented in SystemVerilog RTL.  
The project is intended to serve as a research and educational platform for high-speed interconnect design, as well as a practical solution for FPGA-based PCIe endpoint integration.

---

## Features
- PCIe 1.0 Endpoint Controller written in synthesizable RTL.
- Implements key layers of the PCIe stack:
  - PIPE interface for PHY connectivity.
  - Data Link Layer with sequencing, LCRC, ACK/NAK, and retry logic.
  - Transaction Layer Packet (TLP) handling.
- Example implementations of high-speed interconnect design patterns:
  - Scramblers
  - CRCs
  - Flow Control
- Designed for integration with open-source FPGA toolchains.
- Provides an educational example of PCIe design for teaching and research.
- Lightweight FPGA resource utilization (validated on Xilinx ZCU102).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [FuseSoC](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc) installed and configured.
- Cocotb and Python for simulation-based verification.
- [Verilator] (https://github.com/verilator/verilator) installed and configured.
- FPGA development environment (Xilinx Vivado,openXC7, or Intel Quartus) if synthesizing.
- Git for version control.

### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isomoye-msu/pcie_datalink_layer.git
cd pcie_datalink_layer

git submodule init && git submodule update
```

### Install prereqs with pip

```
  pip install setuptools>=64
